I am (I have been) adding this line while in the MASTER branch 

dbj_interestig_stuff branch has been created after dbj_branch_1 and after MASTER (of course)

and this branch is (yes) dbj_interesting_stuff

Going aged inside this branch ...

After merging branch_1 into the interesting branch I am adding this line.
